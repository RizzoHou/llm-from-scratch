# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Initializing the Memory Bank and Project Structure**

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Memory Bank Setup**: Creating all core memory bank files for the LLM-from-scratch learning project
2. **Project Foundation**: Establishing documentation structure and learning framework
3. **Course Alignment**: Setting up project to follow Stanford CS336 "Language Modeling from Scratch" course

### Current Status
- ✅ Created `projectbrief.md` with basic project overview
- ✅ Created `productContext.md` defining project goals and user experience
- ✅ Created `systemPatterns.md` outlining architecture and design patterns  
- ✅ Created `techContext.md` documenting technologies and setup
- ✅ Created `activeContext.md` (this file) to track current work
- ✅ Created `progress.md` to track project status

## Recent Changes
### Memory Bank Initialization (Today)
1. **Explored existing structure**: Found only `projectbrief.md` in memorybank/
2. **Read projectbrief.md**: Understood project scope as learning LLM from scratch via Stanford CS336
3. **Created core files**: 
   - `productContext.md`: Product goals, problems solved, success metrics
   - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture, design patterns, component relationships
   - `techContext.md`: Technologies, setup, constraints, dependencies
   - `activeContext.md`: Current work tracking (this file)

### Project Structure Considerations
- Following memory bank guidelines from `.clinerules/memorybank.md`
- Ensuring all 6 core files are created with appropriate content
- Aligning documentation with LLM learning project goals

## Next Steps
### Immediate Next Steps (Today)
1. **✅ Complete Memory Bank**: Created `progress.md` to track project status
2. **Verify Structure**: Ensure all 6 core memory bank files are properly linked and consistent
3. **Initial Documentation Review**: Check for completeness and alignment with project goals

### Short-term Planning
1. **Explore Course Materials**: Review Stanford CS336 syllabus and assignments
2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Configure Python, dependencies, project structure
3. **Plan First Assignment**: Identify initial LLM concepts to implement
4. **Create Implementation Structure**: Set up src/, notebooks/, assignments/ directories

### Learning Path Considerations
- Need to understand course progression and assignment sequence
- Determine appropriate starting point for implementation
- Plan documentation approach for each learning module

## Active Decisions and Considerations
### 1. Memory Bank Structure
- **Decision**: Follow exact 6-file structure from `.clinerules/memorybank.md`
- **Rationale**: Ensures comprehensive documentation and future session continuity
- **Consideration**: Balance detail with maintainability for learning project

### 2. Project Scope Definition
- **Decision**: Focus strictly on Stanford CS336 course progression
- **Rationale**: Provides clear structure and learning objectives
- **Consideration**: May need to adapt based on course material availability

### 3. Implementation Approach
- **Decision**: Prioritize understanding over optimization
- **Rationale**: Educational value is primary goal
- **Consideration**: Need to balance conceptual clarity with practical implementation

### 4. Documentation Strategy
- **Decision**: Comprehensive documentation for learning insights
- **Rationale**: Enhances future reference value and knowledge retention
- **Consideration**: Time investment vs learning benefit trade-off

## Important Patterns and Preferences
### Documentation Patterns
- **Learning-First**: Documentation explains concepts, not just code
- **Progressive Detail**: Start high-level, add detail as understanding deepens
- **Cross-Referencing**: Link related concepts across memory bank files

### Development Preferences
- **Modular Implementation**: One concept per file/module
- **Test-Driven Learning**: Verify understanding through implementation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Simple first, optimize later

### Learning Preferences
- **Hands-On Implementation**: Learn by building
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Focus on "why" not just "how"
- **Documentation as Learning Tool**: Writing reinforces understanding

## Learnings and Project Insights
### Initial Insights
1. **Memory Bank Value**: Structured documentation crucial for learning projects
2. **Course Alignment**: Clear external structure (Stanford CS336) provides learning roadmap
3. **Educational Focus**: Different priorities than production projects (clarity over performance)

### Technical Considerations
- LLM implementation requires understanding of multiple domains (NLP, deep learning, optimization)
- Progressive complexity from basic language models to transformers
- Practical constraints (compute, data) may affect implementation scale

### Process Insights
- Memory bank initialization is foundational work
- Clear structure enables consistent progress tracking
- Documentation quality correlates with learning effectiveness

## Open Questions and Uncertainties
1. **Course Material Access**: Exact assignment details and datasets needed
2. **Implementation Depth**: How detailed should each component implementation be?
3. **Timeline Alignment**: How closely to follow course schedule vs self-paced learning?
4. **Resource Requirements**: GPU access needs for training experiments?

## Dependencies and Blockers
### Current Dependencies
- Stanford CS336 course materials availability
- Python environment setup completion
- Understanding of course prerequisites

### Potential Blockers
- Missing course materials or unclear assignment instructions
- Technical challenges with LLM component implementations
- Time constraints for comprehensive learning

## Risk Assessment
### Low Risk
- Memory bank setup and documentation structure
- Basic project organization

### Medium Risk  
- Understanding and implementing advanced LLM concepts
- Keeping pace with course complexity progression

### High Risk
- Resource limitations affecting training experiments
- Conceptual gaps requiring additional prerequisite learning

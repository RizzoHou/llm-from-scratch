# Product Context

## Project Overview
This project documents the learning process of building a Language Model (LLM) from scratch, following the Stanford CS336 "Language Modeling from Scratch" online course.

## Why This Project Exists
- To gain deep, hands-on understanding of how modern language models work at a fundamental level
- To document the learning journey from basic concepts to practical implementation
- To create a reference repository for future learning and experimentation
- To complete course assignments and exercises systematically

## Problems It Solves
1. **Knowledge Gap**: Provides structured learning path for understanding LLM internals
2. **Documentation Gap**: Creates comprehensive notes and implementation examples
3. **Reference Gap**: Builds a reusable codebase for future LLM experiments
4. **Learning Gap**: Bridges theoretical concepts with practical implementation

## How It Should Work
- Follow the Stanford CS336 course structure and assignments
- Implement each concept with clean, well-documented code
- Include explanatory notes and learning insights
- Maintain a logical progression from basics to advanced topics
- Serve as both a learning tool and reference implementation

## User Experience Goals
- **For the Learner**: Clear, incremental learning with working examples
- **For Future Reference**: Well-organized code and documentation
- **For Community**: Shareable insights and implementations
- **For Educators**: Example implementations for teaching purposes

## Success Metrics
- Complete all course assignments
- Document key learning insights
- Build functional LLM components
- Create reusable code patterns
- Establish comprehensive understanding of LLM fundamentals

2. **Implementation Specifics**: Exact LLM component specifications pending course review
3. **Data Requirements**: Training datasets and evaluation metrics not yet defined

### Technical Uncertainties
1. **Resource Requirements**: GPU access and compute needs for training
2. **Implementation Complexity**: Depth of implementation for educational vs production use
3. **Dependency Management**: Python library versions and compatibility

### Process Questions
1. **Pacing**: Self-paced vs course-schedule alignment
2. **Depth vs Breadth**: How many concepts to implement in detail
3. **Documentation Balance**: How much detail in learning notes vs code comments

## Evolution of Project Decisions
### Initial Decisions (Today)
1. **Memory Bank Structure**: Adopted 6-file framework from `.clinerules/memorybank.md`
2. **Project Scope**: Strict focus on Stanford CS336 course progression
3. **Learning Focus**: Prioritize understanding over optimization
4. **Documentation Strategy**: Comprehensive learning-focused documentation

### Rationale for Decisions

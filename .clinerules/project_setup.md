# Project Setup

Rules for initial project setup and environment configuration.

## Setup Requirements

- **Initial Setup**: If you are new to this project, explore it thoroughly to gain a comprehensive understanding of the codebase, architecture, and workflow before making changes.

- **Environment Configuration**: Always activate or configure the project environment (virtual environment, container, or development setup) before running scripts or commands to ensure correct dependency resolution and consistent behavior.

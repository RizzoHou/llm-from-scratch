# Documentation Standards

Rules for maintaining project documentation.

## Documentation Requirements

- **Feature Documentation**: Update relevant documentation in `docs/` when modifying or adding features to ensure documentation stays synchronized with code changes.

- **Memory Bank Maintenance**: Update relevant documentation in `memorybank/` throughout the development process to maintain accurate project context and enable effective future sessions.

- **Document Decisions and Rationale**: Maintain thorough documentation practices. Document your decisions, changes, and rationale as you work to provide context for future development.
